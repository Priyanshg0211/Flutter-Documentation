# Dart Basics

In this section, I've covered the basics of Dart programming language. Below are the topics I've covered so far:

1. Variables and Data Types
2. Functions
3. Control Flow (if-else statements, loops)
4. Lists and Maps
5. Classes and Objects
6. Inheritance and Polymorphism

Feel free to explore these topics to get a solid understanding of Dart before diving deeper into Flutter.
